# Capella, next gen Cloud AI service for everyone

## Vision
* Data scientiests, deep learning algorithm researchers should not care for infrastructure
* AI service should be simple enough for everyone to use
* Code should auto scale out as more resources are available
* Large model should be tamed by a new platform for wide adoption
* Cloud computing shifts to sky computing and severless computing

## Technologies Highlights
* Automated and dynamic resource configuration, compliment multi-tenant in a optimized way
* Efficient storage and workflow for function orchestration
* Minimize data movement, maximize parellelism, data locality
* Simplified elastic AI training, flow and model auto split
* GPU centric, Heterogeneous resource management
* Apache arrow data format for in-memory data processing and data transfer (same format on the wire, no need SerDes)

## User Interface
* Browser based work studio; model service API for integration
* Large selections of dataset and models
* Friendly progress tracking and debugging interface
* Sharable, executable functions/workflow

## About us
* Chief Architects and hard-core Engineers from leading cloud lab.
